  <h2 class="section-headline">The CSS file</h2>

  <div>
    <p>Visit the <a href="../">main page</a> to customize and download a California Stylesheet.</p>
    <p>Or just grab one with our colors <a href="../ca.css">here</a>.</p>

  </div>
</section>

<section class="gutter-bottom">
  <h3>Reference ca.css</h3>
  <p>Reference the file inside the head tag:</p>
  <pre class="gutter-bottom">&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="ca.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>

  <h3>The &lt;style&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>Or you can include it in the HTML:</p>
  <pre>&lt;style&gt;[[ the whole output ]]&lt;/style&gt;</pre>

  <h2 class="section-headline">Visual Studio Code</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Both palette options are also available through the Visual Studio Code extension. Install it in two minutes.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=casscss.CASS-viewer" target="_blank"><img src="../images/cass-viewer.png" alt="A screenshot of the CASS viewer extension in VS Code"></a></p>
    
    <p>While in Visual Studio Code, launch VS Code Quick Open (<strong>Ctrl+P</strong>), paste the following command, and press Enter:</p>
    <p><code>ext install casscss.CASS-viewer</code></p>
    <p>After it's done installing, you'll be able to quickly access the CASS palette and CSS generator inside of Visual Studio Code by bringing up the command palette with <strong>Ctrl + Shift + P</strong> and typing "CASS."</p>

  <h2>Tweaking your CASS</h2>
  
  <p>Your California Stylesheet is powered by CSS custom properties, which are listed at the top of the file. You can modify these values directly to change your project's style standards, or overwrite them in a CSS theme:</p>

  <pre>:root {
  --font-size-base: 18px;
  --line-height: 2;    
}</pre>

  <p>Write or include your own CSS in a file (or on the page) but after CASS. You can also edit your CASS file directly, but that can make it harder to swap out later. It's usually better to go with a "write-on-top" approach, even if you're using a preprocessor.</p>

    <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
    <div class="gutter-bottom">
      <p>CASS keeps things simple:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No numerals (1, 5, 100, etc)</li>
        <li>No abbreviations (xt, MGS, xt:phablet-xxt)</li>
        <li>If it already exists, use that word</li>
        <li>"No" is powerful, and overrides other classes</li>
        <li>One- or two-word shortcuts to everything useful</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="no-margin-top">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h5>"What's the file size?"</h5>
    <p>About <strong>30kb</strong>.</p>
    <p>California Stylesheets are meant to be human-readable, not gzipped, tucked away in the JS or otherwise obscured from the user.</p>
    <p>It's not a minimalist microframework or an entrenched all-style solution. It's a middleweight CSS file for people who need to give structure and style to a page fast, all while maintaining a site's style standards.</p>

    <h5>"If it's not a framework, what is it?"</h5>
    <p>It's a really good base CSS file for any page or project, customized to fit a brand color.</p>

    <h5>"Is it better than other CSS frameworks?"</h5>
    <p>It's easier to use. Sometimes it can do more and sometimes it can't. It doesn't require you to install npm, to preprocess anything, to post-process anything, to gzip, to tree-shake, to learn new words, or to burden your templates/views with new conventions outside of HTML.</p>
    <p>It's not CSS-in-JS or pre-CSS or post-JS or anything like that. It's ca.css and you reference it in your HTML. Very lazy people just paste it into a style tag. We're cool with that approach.</p>

    <h5>"Should I switch from another CSS framework?"</h5>
    <p>CASS is aimed mostly at people who are frustrated with all the administrative overhead and process stuff that goes into writing CSS these days. If that sounds like you, try it out.</p>
    <p>Even if you can't use CASS in your main project, it's a great tool for prototyping or for smaller satellite projects. CASS mostly plays nice with other CSS projects but very little care has been taken to namespace anything. (This may be an option in the future!)</p>

    <h5>"What's the deal with all the color stuff?"</h5>
    <p>If you have a red CASS-powered site, you can very easily switch over to having a blue CASS-powered website just by switching in a new California Stylesheet.</p>
    <p>Your new site's idea of what "orange" means and what "dark" means will all slightly change to fit the new brand color without having to go through and pick new alternatives.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, it's just a color system that gives you a really huge available palette with only a handful of base words. You can refine colors right there in the HTML by adding classes like dark, light and dim.</p>

    <h5>"So 'purple' isn't even a real color?"</h5>
    <p>The color palette is standard, but not the colors themselves. The class called "purple" will look slightly different between California Stylesheets. There's no single hex value that represents CASS's concept of purple (but there will be for your particular California Stylesheet).</p>

    <h5>"So 'purple' might not even be purple?"</h5>
    <p>No, purple will always look purple.</p>

    <h5>"Are you sure this isn't CSS-in-JS?"</h5>
    <p>It's not CSS-in-JS. It's more like CSS-in-HTML.</p>

    <h5>"And it's not a preprocessor?"</h5>
    <p>It's not. CASS is a language of sorts unto itself, but it plays out entirely within the <strong>class=""</strong> part of an HTML tag. There's no compiling or processing step.</p>
    <p>On the contrary, CASS is all about avoiding preprocessing or treating your CSS in any way.</p>

    <h5>"I don't know CSS. Can I use CASS?"</h5>
    <p>Of course! That's basically the whole point.</p>
    <p>All you need to use California Stylesheets is knowledge of how HTML works. If you can put together HTML elements and add classes to those elements, you're ready to use get started.</p>
    <p>In fact, CASS is a great way to learn CSS, because so many of the classes and conventions use names and terms from CSS.</p>

    <h5>"Wait, the point is writing <em>less</em> CSS?"</h5>
    <p>The point is to cover about 95% of a site's basic design needs and to write about 90% less CSS overall, yes. The composable classes based on standards do most of the boring parts of design and layout for you. With CASS, the remaining CSS that needs to be written is the last 5%-- the fun 5% that really makes a page stand out.</p>

    <h5>"I don't know Less. Can I use CASS?"</h5>
    <p>Use any preprocessor you want alongside a California Stylesheet. All of the important variables are available there through CSS custom properties.</p>
    <p>CASS is powered by Less. The Less version of CASS makes a great starting </p>

    <h5>"I don't know Cassandra. Can I use CASS?"</h5>
    <p>California Stylesheets has nothing at all to do with Cassandra DB. That came out wrong. We're sure they're great. It's a backend thing, right?</p>
